This script is based on vimtip #146. It enables you to open any amount of files at once using the edit command. You can simply provide multiple parameters or use glob patterns.

Examples:

:edit foo.txt bar.txt
:edit foo/**/*.txt

UPDATE:
I just found out that :args does just what this script tries to do.
